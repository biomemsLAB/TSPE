# TSPE: Total Spiking Probability Edges

Total Spiking Probability Edges (TSPE) is a cross-correlation-based method for effective connectivity estimation of cortical spiking neurons.

## Background

Connectivity is a critical parameter in understanding the information flow within neuronal networks. Reconstructing network connectivity from recorded spike train data has been an area of active research, leading to the development of various estimation methods.

## About TSPE

TSPE is a novel and computationally efficient algorithm designed for effective connectivity estimation. Its primary features include:

1. **Cross-Correlation**: TSPE calculates a cross-correlation between pairs of spike trains to measure their relationship.
2. **Edge Filters**: It applies filters on the resulting cross-correlograms to distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory connections.

### Key Results

* **Performance**: TSPE achieves a high true positive rate (approx. 99%) with a low false positive rate (1%) for low-density random networks, depending on the network topology and spike train duration.
* **Efficiency**: It processes large datasets quickly, taking less than three minutes on a high-performance computer to estimate connectivity from an hour-long dataset of 1000 spike trains.
* **Distinction Capability**: The algorithm effectively distinguishes between excitatory and inhibitory connections.
